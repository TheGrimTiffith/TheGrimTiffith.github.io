Random thoughts and tinkering on software. Despite working in the industry for ~15 years *(as of 2022/2/18)* I have roughly **zero** externally visible footprint. 
So thought it worth seeing if I could make the time to document some employer-agnostic stuff externally, with a mix of what I'm *best* at as well as what I'm trying to *learn*.
