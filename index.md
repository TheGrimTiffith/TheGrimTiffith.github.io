Random thoughts and tinkering on software. Despite working in the industry for ~15 years *(as of 2022/2/18)* my total externally visible footprint is a [talk at AWS re:invent in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MZtBMjOFsQ) and some [patents of distinctly dubious value](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Timothy+Peter+Griffith%22&tbm=pts) - where each company I work at seems to name me differently? So I thought it worth seeing if I could make the time to document some employer-agnostic stuff externally, with a mix of what I'm *best* at as well as what I'm trying to *learn*.
