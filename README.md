# Personal Blog
This repo is intended to be the basis of a personal blog. Time will tell if I can actually build content for it, vs this being a 1 day exercise. There is likely nothing of re-usable value, and the educational value of the source itself is 
likewise expected to be extremely minimal as it's just content into the structure outlined in the [github pages lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages) 
using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) as the static website generator and the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
